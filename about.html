            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>When I started college at UTEP as a Computer Science major, I already knew I wanted to focus on Artificial Intelligence. Something about the idea of machines learning, adapting, and solving problems pulled me in, and I've been chasing that curiosity ever since.</p>

            <p>Since then, I've thrown myself into learning, building, and growing. Iâ€™ve joined clubs, worked on projects that challenged me, and explored areas like machine learning, web development, and open-source. Along the way, I've learned to work through more than just technical challenges. I've learned to better understand myself, reflect, and keep pushing forward.</p>

            <p>At the heart of it all is connection: with people, with challenges, and with ideas worth pursuing. Whether Iâ€™m helping students and faculty at UTEP, coordinating inclusive events for children, or experimenting with new projects, I show up with intention to create something meaningful and leave a positive mark.</p>

            <p>More than anything, I hope my journey encourages others to take that first step, whether itâ€™s trying something new, believing in their potential, or simply choosing to keep growing. Weâ€™re all figuring it out, and thatâ€™s the best part.</p>

            <p>I care about learning alongside others, sharing ideas, and pushing myself creatively and technically. If there's a new concept to explore or a challenge to grow through, count me in.</p>

            <h2>Outside of Tech</h2>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>âš½ Playing soccer with friends</li>
                <li>ðŸŽ­ Acting and performing (I love theater!)</li>
                <li>ðŸ§  Exploring new tech ideas and side projects</li>
                <li>ðŸ’¼ Learning more about entrepreneurship and creative growth</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>"Stay curious. Stay creative. Keep building." </blockquote>
