            <h3>Building My Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>This portfolio you're seeing is 100% custom built. I wanted a place to show not just my skills, but who I am — the creativity behind the tech. It’s still a work in progress, and I'm loving the process of making it better every day.</p>

            <h3>Becoming More Than Just a Developer </h3>
            <p>Lately, I've been focusing on growing in ways that aren't just technical. Things like better problem solving, clearer communication, creative thinking, and just showing up with passion in whatever I'm doing — from open-source to soccer fields.</p>

            <h3>Small Wins, Big Motivation </h3>
            <p>Every time I finish a project, solve a bug, help someone with tech, or even just learn something new — I feel it’s a small win. Those wins add up. That’s what’s driving me right now: not just chasing goals, but recognizing growth along the way.</p>
